        <h2>Course Contract</h2>

        <p>
            I, <a href="introduction.html">Adrienne Potts</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB115-N801 Web Development Course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>

        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Signed: <em>Adrienne Potts, 15 August 2024</em>
